# MaterialSettingsPlugin

This plugin adds more settings for materials on the Materials pane of the preferences.

This plugin does not change the fact that if a setting value is specified in the "sidebar" settings or in a quality profile, this always overrides the value set for the material.

To configure which settings are included in your materials preferences, go to `Extensions -> Material Settings -> Configure Material Settings`, and select the settings you wish to include. You'll then find the selected settings availble under the `Print settings` tab of your material preferences (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>).
